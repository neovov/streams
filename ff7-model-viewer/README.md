# FF7 Model Viewer (PSX)

The goal of this project was to understand how character's file in FF7 (PSX) was structured.

The [source code](model-viewer.js) gets a, previously decompressed, BCX file, parse it and render it using Three.js. It is also possible to drag&drop a file on the document.

Great resources:

- [Mirror of QhimmWiki]([https://wiki.ffrtt.ru/index.php/FF7/Field/BCX]), a great resource for reverse engineering some of Square Soft PSX games.
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) obviously.
